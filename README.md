# Sorting-And-Path-Finding-Visualization-In-Java
Create a Java and JavaFX project to address the need for visually intuitive representations of sorting (Bubble, Insertion, Heap, Quick) and pathfinding (Dijkstra's, A*, BFS) algorithms, facilitating a deeper understanding of their inner workings and comparative efficiency in real-world scenarios.
